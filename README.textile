h1. Nothing here yet.

Plans for this jQuery plugin:

*Create panel that slides into view from any direction
*Remember last state a user left the panel in and use that on reload
*Have a button that is clicked to toggle state. Be able to set content of
this button in open/closed states (eg, a unicode up or down arrow) and/or set
open/closed classes for CSS to do this vi a background image.
